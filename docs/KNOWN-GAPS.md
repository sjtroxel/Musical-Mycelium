# Known gaps at `v0.3.0-local`

Written 2026-08-12, at the phase 3 release step. Required by
`docs/phases/phase-3-agent-loop-IMPLEMENTATION.md` §5.1, which asks that the tag ship with the open items
named and the residual gaps stated plainly.

**Verified state at the time of writing:** `make check` green — 640 passed, 7 `costs_money` tests
deselected, mypy clean, root 15/18, terraform valid. Working tree clean at `700bad3`. Every claim below
was re-derived against the repo rather than copied from the previous handoff.

**Bedrock is not a blocker.** Access was restored 2026-08-11 after a twelve-day account-level quota fault.
Nothing here is waiting on AWS. What remains is unrun work, one hand-authored dataset, and a small number
of standing facts about the corpus.

## Part 1 — open items, closable

Each of these can be finished. Mark `[x]` when it is, with the evidence.

### DoD #11 — refusal accuracy and traversal recall on real model output

The item is open and its two halves are open for different reasons. They do not close together.

- [ ] **Refusal accuracy against a real model.** Unrun, not unbuilt. `eval/harness.py:65` hardcodes
  `DATASET` to the adversarial set and takes no provider argument, so every recorded number in
  `eval/datasets/baseline_v0_3_0_local.json` is scripted. Two live anecdotes exist
  (`test_an_unresolvable_name_is_refused_rather_than_invented`, and the gate test beside it) but an
  anecdote is not a rate. Closing this is a wiring change plus one billable run.
- [ ] **Traversal recall against a real model.** Weaker than unrun: it has **never been scored on any run,
  scripted or live.** `traversal_recall` and `traversal_precision` exist in `eval/metrics.py` and their
  only callers in the entire repo are `tests/test_metrics.py`. They need expected paths, which live in the
  gold set, which holds **5 cases**. This half is blocked behind the gold set below, not behind Bedrock.

### DoD #12 — token cost to CloudWatch

The item is partial, and its two clauses are in different states.

- [x] **The working model ID is recorded.** `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`, at
  `phase-3-agent-loop-IMPLEMENTATION.md:547` and in `.claude/rules/aws-and-cost.md`.
- [ ] **Token cost measured and emitted to CloudWatch.** Measured: yes, real usage off `Done`, and
  `api/telemetry.py` is unit-tested. Emitted: **no EMF record has ever reached CloudWatch.** The deployed
  Lambda runs `llm_provider=local`, so its token counts are synthetic, and the live tests run on a
  developer machine where stdout is a terminal rather than a log stream. The format is proven; the
  pipeline is not. Requires the redeploy below.
- [x] **`MYCELIUM_TOKEN_PRICES` is absent from `infra/terraform/main/lambda.tf`'s environment block.**
  **Fixed 2026-08-12.** Added as `var.token_prices`, defaulting to `""`. Empty is a working state, not a
  broken one — token counts still reach CloudWatch and dollars stay silent — and `load_prices` already
  treats empty and unset identically. Present-and-empty rather than absent so the silence is visibly
  deliberate after a Bedrock redeploy. No price is hardcoded anywhere; the variable description carries a
  format illustration and says in terms not to copy numbers out of it.

### DoD #10 — breadth, not existence

The item is **green**: `tests/test_bedrock_live.py:247` passes against a real model. What it covers is
narrower than the sentence sounds, and the narrowness is the gap.

- [x] **A real model ignores an injected node label.** One case (`adv_014`), one channel, one model, one
  run. The test's own docstring states the limit correctly: `gate()` would refuse the forbidden triple
  whether or not the model honoured the delimiter, so a pass is defence in depth **confirmed**, not
  discovered.
- [ ] **`adv_015` has no live counterpart.** The hostile stub tool is exercised only under
  `tests/test_untrusted.py`. The second injection channel has never met a real model.
- [ ] **Injection resistance is not reported as a rate against a real model.** Five cases score locally;
  one scores live. Closing this is the same billable harness run as DoD #11's first half.

### The deployed URL

- [ ] **The public URL runs the local provider.** It walks the graph, gates claims and cites real Wikidata
  statement URIs, but **the prose comes from a template and the token counts are synthetic.** This is the
  only claim in this document that is true without qualification, and it is the one with consequences
  outside the repo. A deployed demo running on a template must never be described as a live agent.
- [ ] **The Function URL is `authorization_type = "NONE"`** (`infra/terraform/main/lambda.tf:135`). Today
  that is free to abuse. After a Bedrock redeploy it puts a billable model behind a public unauthenticated
  URL, bounded only by reserved concurrency and the timeout — and per `.claude/rules/aws-and-cost.md`, a
  streamed response bills the full function duration even when the visitor closes the tab. Redeploying
  onto Bedrock and leaving this unaddressed are two decisions, not one.

### Documentation that now understates the build

- [x] **Six places state that the loop has never run end to end against a real model. All six were false
  as of 2026-08-12. Rewritten the same day.** Note the direction of the error: every one **understated**
  what works, so nothing public was overclaiming and none of it was urgent.

  `README.md:38` (the public one, and the only one a recruiter reads) · `docs/ROADMAP.md:296` ·
  `src/musical_mycelium/agent/llm.py:22` · `src/musical_mycelium/agent/__init__.py:45` ·
  `docs/phases/phase-1-walking-skeleton-IMPLEMENTATION.md:20` and `:394`

  What replaced them is narrower, not wider: **the loop is live-verified end to end, real-model behaviour
  is demonstrated but not measured, and the deployed URL still runs the template stub.** Verified by a
  whitespace-normalised search rather than a line-based grep — the sixth site was invisible to the
  original grep because the phrase wrapped across two lines, which is how the earlier count of five
  happened.

- [x] **`README.md:21` read 623 tests; the suite is 640** plus 7 deselected. **Fixed 2026-08-12**, and
  the deselected count is now stated rather than dropped.
- [x] **`phase-3-agent-loop-IMPLEMENTATION.md` §5.1 needed a pointer to this file** rather than a
  duplicate. **Done 2026-08-12.** Its release-step items 1 and 2 are struck through, and the superseded
  08-11 wording is kept with its reasoning rather than deleted.

### The precondition that gates phase 4

- [ ] **The gold set holds 5 cases of a planned 20–30, and the sealed held-out 10 does not exist.**
  `eval/datasets/gold_v0_1.json`. Both must be hand-authored **while no model output exists**; once step 8
  runs against a real model that property is destroyed permanently and cannot be recovered. This gates
  DoD #11's traversal-recall half and the whole of phase 4. It is not delegable, and there is no schedule
  pressure on it — a set labelled badly is worse than a set labelled late, because every correctness
  number the project ever reports inherits its errors.

## Part 2 — standing limits, not tasks

These do not get checkboxes. They are properties of the corpus and the design, and stating them is the
point of this document. Some will change if phase 6 changes the corpus; none of them is a defect.

**The recorded baseline measures the machinery, not the model.** Every run in
`baseline_v0_3_0_local.json` is scripted. It shows that the gate and the loop refuse unsupported claims.
It does **not** show that a real model resists. That sentence is the first field of the JSON itself, not a
footnote, because a number that leaves the file without it will eventually be quoted as evidence about a
model.

**Contested is unbuildable on this corpus.** Detecting genuine disagreement needs a second independent
source, and this corpus has exactly one per edge. What the output distinguishes is how strongly a single
source was checked, and where two independent checks reached opposite verdicts. `contested` and
`checks_disagree` are defined, documented, and test-locked as unreachable rather than quietly dropped.
Decision A1; not to be re-litigated.

**Every claim the adversarial set produces is `HAND` verified — all seven of them.** The set never touches
a `PROSE_AUTO` edge, which is the overwhelming majority of the corpus, so the baseline says nothing about
behaviour on machine-verified edges. That is a gap in the **dataset**, not the code, and it belongs to the
gold set. A test fails if the mix ever changes, so it cannot quietly stop being true.

**Grounded means provenance, not truth.** Every edge traces to a checkable source. Wikidata can still be
wrong and musical influence is genuinely contested. Nothing in this project's copy, docs or interview
material may slide from "traceable" to "correct."

**The corpus skews Western, anglophone and recent, by construction.** It is reported as a computed number
rather than a disclaimer. Concentration is not absence: the corpus spans 500 CE to the present across 29
places, and 43 of its genres name no US or UK origin at all.

**Genres are thin.** The best-connected genre nodes top out at four outgoing edges; artists reach 25.
`techno` (`Q170611`) has **zero** edges, so "Where did Detroit techno come from?" correctly refuses. Pick
live-test and demo queries with that in mind — a refusal there is the product working, but it is a poor
first impression.

**Three quota axes bind, and the third is new.** 10 RPM is the binding constraint for a single query
(a plan turn, one turn per hop, then synthesis), 5M TPM is not, and **27,000,000 tokens per day on Haiku
4.5** locks the model out for the rest of the calendar day if blown. TPM recovers in sixty seconds; the
daily cap does not. Phase 4's eval throttling needs a cumulative-token budget, not only per-request
backoff.

**No thresholds and no judge exist, deliberately.** Phase 3 records baselines; phase 4 sets gates. Per
`.claude/rules/evals.md`, thresholds invented before a baseline exists are worthless, and an LLM-judge
score with no measured human agreement is decoration.

## What closing these is worth

The resume line *"deployed on AWS Lambda and Bedrock with a deterministic groundedness gate at 100%"* is
**not claimable at `v0.3.0-local`**, because what is deployed runs a template. It becomes claimable at the
redeploy, and not before.

The interview-facing statement, rounded **down** rather than up: the loop works end to end against a real
model, what is deployed is still a stub, and the eval numbers measure the machinery rather than the model.
